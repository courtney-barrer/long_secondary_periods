-merged and pulled long_secondary_periods to include all the PMOIRED fits with the MiRA image reconstructions 
-after merge tested PLAY_PIONIER.py and image reconstructions

-created plot_utils.py and fixed some plot bugs with oi_merged[i]
-confirmed with ERIC that we need to construct CP from MirA returned visibilities
- in process tp verify consistency between oi fits of 
observed data and the coordinates / observables returned by MiRA
.. doing this in MIRA_imageReco_analysis_PIONIER.py first


issue with returned visibilities in Mira models 
emailed Eric about it.

Testing in 
MIRA_imageReco_analysis_PIONIER.py
